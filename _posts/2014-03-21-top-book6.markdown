## Book 6 - Management

***Thus spake the master programmer:**  
“Let the programmers be many and the managers few - then all will be productive.”*

***编程大师如是说：**  
“增加程序员，减少经理——那样他们的效率就都能得以提高。”*

### 6.1

When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games. When accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget is about to be cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll in.  
当经理们开着没完没了的会时，程序员们在写着游戏。当会计们在谈论季度盈利时，开发预算被削减了。当老科学家们谈论着蓝天时，云团滚滚而来。
 
Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.  
这不叫编程之道。
 
When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When accountants make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to be restored. When senior scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will soon be solved.  
当经理们分配了任务，游戏程序被扔在一边。当会计们在做了长期计划，和谐与秩序得以恢复。当老科学家们着手定位出了问题，立即就能得以解决。
 
Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.  
这才是编程之道。

### 6.2

Why are programmers non-productive?  
程序员们为何低效？  
Because their time is wasted in meetings.  
因为他们的时间被浪费在了开会上。  
Why are programmers rebellious?  
程序员们为何叛逆？  
Because the management interferes too much.  
因为管理人员们过分地干预。  
Why are the programmers resigning one by one?  
程序员们为何一个接一个地辞职了？  
Because they are burnt out.  
因为他们受够了。  
Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.  
在糟糕的管理下工作，体现不出他们的价值。

### 6.3

A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him invented a new program that became popular and sold well. As a result, the manager retained his job.  
有个经理快被炒鱿鱼了，但是他手下的一个程序员写出了一个很流行的软件，而且卖的火热。于是这位经理就这么保住了它的工作。
 
The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer refused it, saying, “I wrote the program because I thought it was an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward.”  
经理试图给这位程序员一些奖励，但是程序员回绝了：“我写这个程序只是因为它是个很有趣的设想，而且我也没期待过要得到什么回报。”
 
The manager upon hearing this remarked, “This programmer, though he holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an employee. Let us promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!”  
经理听了以后，说到：“这位程序员，无论他处于怎样卑微的位置，都能够很好地理解雇员的应有的职责所在。我们应该把他提升到顾问级的高管职位。”
 
But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, “I exist so that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste everyone’s time. Can I go now? I have a program that I’m working on."  
但是经理讲完了这番话，程序员再度回绝了：“我是个程序员，所以我能编程。如果我升职了，我什么都做不了，只会浪费别人的时间。现在我可以走了吗？我的程序还没写完呢。”

### 6.4

A manager went to his programmers and told them: “As regards to your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave at five in the afternoon.” At this, all of them became angry and several resigned on the spot."  
一位经理告诉他的程序员：“你们要遵守公司的考勤规定呀，我们的上班时间是朝九晚五。”程序员们听了以后纷纷表示很生气。
 
So the manager said: “All right, in that case you may set your own working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.” The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the wee hours of the morning.  
然后经理说：“好吧，随你们怎么安排时间，只要能按计划完成项目就好。”程序员这回满意了，他们从中午开始上班，一直干到凌晨。
